phase 3 - close the open threads, add depth
================================================

what is this branch pr/insights-88b3b3?


phase 1 (done, see [phase.1.md](phase.1.md)) built one player's loop.
phase 2 (done, see [phase.2.md](phase.2.md)) deepened it - a real
universe, roles and visibility, ship traffic, dijkstra routing and
travel manifests. what's left behind both is a large, unsorted backlog:
`game.md`'s ideas, `tech.debt.md`, `permissions.md`'s "what stays open",
and `client.md`'s TODO/accepted-risks/bugs lists. phase 3 curates a
scoped slice of it - close what previous phases explicitly left open,
add the depth that's actually within reach, defer what needs more
thinking or a bigger commitment first.

the eve-online research spike ([eve.md](../../docs/eve.md)) is done - its
architecture notes (time dilation, single-shard economy) stay reference
material, not scheduled work.


steps
------------------------------------------------

phase-scoped numbering (3.1-3.7), not a continuation of phase 2's.
order follows priority, not file size: the name generator and tech-debt
sweep open small and easy, ship modules, the player messenger and ΔV
mechanics carry this phase's real player-facing depth, universe growth
and travel manifest visualization close it out. 3.3 is now a real
dependency of 3.4's ansible hardware and 3.5's maneuver drive; the later
content and visualization steps remain independent.

### step 3.1 - ships name generator

was a dangling, unscheduled idea at the bottom of `phase.2.md` ("step
2.5", never added to that table). every new ship gets a random name
instead of the one fixed `starterShip.name = 'far treasure'`
(`packages/domain/src/universe.js`).

source data is already staged: `.dacrap/culture-*.csv` - Iain M. Banks'
Culture-series ship names, real data, not invented for this. promote the
relevant column into the repo proper, same move `docs/hygdata_v42.csv`
already made for star distances. add a `randomShipName()` export to
`packages/domain`, call it from `apps/ship-service/src/handlers.js`'s
`playerCreated` saga in place of the hardcoded name. renaming after
creation is already done ✔ (phase 1) - this only changes the starting
name.

**done ✔, built wider than the open call above.** the game will need
names at npc scale later, not only one starter ship per player - a
fixed ~160-name list repeats fast at that volume. `randomShipName()`
(`packages/domain/src/shipNames.js`) picks from 3 generators each call:
the curated Culture list, or one of 2 word-pool templates (adjective +
noun + a punny tail), giving tens of thousands of combinations. npc
fleets themselves stay out of scope - `game.md`'s own phase-1 call, not
reopened here.

side effect, fixed alongside: the client had a "name your ship" nudge
that only made sense when every ship started with the same fixed
placeholder name. dropped - `client/js/render.js`, `events.js`,
`session.js`, `state.js`, `api.js`. a rename is still one click away,
just not forced on first login.


### step 3.2 - tech debt sweep

small, independent fixes, bundled because each is too small for its own
step:

- ✔ **service uptime** - `scripts/services-check.js` now reads
  `.logs/<name>.pid` (the same file `start.sh`/`stop.sh` already use),
  and reports up/down, pid, and real uptime per service, next to the
  existing role/owns metadata. exits 1 if anything is down.

- ✔ **`NODE_ENV=dev|prod|test`** - `.env.dev` sets `NODE_ENV=test`,
  which reaches gateway via `main.js` → `createRoutes({ nodeEnv })`;
  the per-request log line skips itself in test. `garage/compose`
  already reads `NODE_ENV` on its own - `test` falls into the same
  branch as `dev` there, which is the wanted behavior, not a gap.

- ✔ **cargo hydrate bug** - `apps/gateway/src/queries.js`'s
  `cargo()` query now filters `AND c.quantity > 0`, matching what the
  live socket path already did (`mutateCargo()` in `client/js/events.js`
  splices a zero-quantity row out). a fresh page load can no longer show
  a "0 ore" line the live path would have hidden.

- ✔ **fix poll calls**, remove redundant function wrappers and fix types

- ✔ **sql code style uppercase** - unify sql code style, make all
  uppercase and aligned, `apps/gateway/src/queries.js`'s style.

  the blocker went first: tests no longer mock by matching sql text at
  all, so the reformat could no longer break one silently.
  `packages/testing/src/mocks.js` gained 2 routing modes - `fakeClient`/
  `fakePool` answer by call order (a queue, not a lookup); the shared,
  many-caller pools in `test/gateway.spec.js` route by the sorted set of
  tables a query touches, parsed from the query itself. neither ever
  matches on sql wording. every unit test file (`db`, `gateway`,
  `market`, `player`, `ship`) converted.

  then the reformat itself: every raw sql string in `apps/market-service`,
  `apps/player-service`, `apps/projection-service`, `apps/ship-service`,
  `packages/db`, and `packages/service` now uppercases keywords and
  right-aligns them, same as `queries.js`. migration `.sql` files stay as
  they are - out of scope, a separate, larger surface.

- ✔ **fetch - Sync** in tests: replace fetch, post calls with `garage/sync`

- ✔ **confirm dialog before travel** (`client.md` bugs list) - a misclick
  shouldn't commit a ship to a trip, more so now a click can mean
  several hops. a click on a reachable station opens `#travelDialog`
  (same shape as the trade/rename dialogs) instead of sending `/travel`
  straight away; `CONFIRM` sends it, `CANCEL` closes with nothing sent.

- ✔ **pending-command timeout** (`client.md` accepted risks) - a lost
  command leaves a `…` feed line forever; a client-side timeout now
  marks it failed instead. `commands.js`'s `send()` starts a 15s timer
  per `correlation_id`; `events.js`'s `dispatch()` clears it on the
  normal resolve path; `resetPlayer()` clears any still running on
  logout.

(already fixed alongside this doc, not gated on this step: the stale
travel-manifests TODO in `packages/domain/readme.md`.)


### step 3.3 - ship modules: rigs and upgrades

the important separations are acquisition, carriage and fitting. a
player may buy and resell a railgun even when the current ship cannot fit
it. fitting validates typed and sized slots, hull/module rates,
power and the module's installation context.

phase 3 proves a narrow but complete loop:

- give the starter ship a hull profile and legal starting rig
- introduce sparse station markets for packaged modules
- install, remove and atomically replace modules
- derive capacity and interstellar velocity from hull plus rig
- ship a small power, cruise and cargo catalogue with real trade-offs
- show requirements and before/after stats before confirmation

exact prices, increments and hull maximums stay balance data. full ship
classes, manufacturing, damage and research trees remain later work.
3.4 adds the ansible as a comms module; 3.5 adds maneuver drives through
the same foundation.


### step 3.4 - player messenger, the ansible

`game.md`'s "player 2 player communications" idea: "some kind of
ansible device that enables faster than light speed coms. but still
with delay, no instant/immediate message transfer." ship traffic and
per-station presence already went public in step 2.3
(`client/js/traffic.js`'s `dockedAt()`) - this is the messaging half of
that same idea, deliberately dropped from that step at the time.

**scope, decided at step start**: 2 message kinds, not 1.

- **station chat** - instant, public to every player currently docked at
  the same station. cheap: the presence data already exists
  (`dockedAt()`), this only needs a message log and a ws broadcast
  scoped to that station's currently-docked sockets.
- **ansible direct message** - private, player-to-player, delayed by
  distance. not instant - that's the whole point of the idea. the delay
  reuses the domain's existing distance math, at a new, much
  faster-than-any-ship `ANSIBLE_SPEED` constant (env-backed, alongside
  `TIME_SCALE`/`SUBLIGHT` in `packages/domain/src/universe.js`) - fast
  enough to be useful, slow enough that a cross-system reply is never in
  the same breath as the message. 0 delay when sender and recipient are
  docked at the same station.

an ansible is fitted comms hardware from step 3.3, not an account power.
both ships need a compatible fitted transceiver when the message is
sent. once accepted into the delivery queue, later removing a
transceiver does not recall the message. phase 3's one-ship-per-player
loop makes the endpoints unambiguous; fleet messaging needs its own
addressing decision later.

**delivery is a poll, not a timer** - the same shape `arrivals.js`
already proved, `arrives`/`arrived` and all: `message.send.requested`
writes a row with a computed `deliver` (the scheduled instant, same
role `arrives` plays on `ships`); `poll()` (`@theseus/util`, the same
primitive `pollArrivals`/`pollOutbox` already use) claims rows where
`deliver <= now()` and sets `delivered` (nullable until then, same role
`arrived` plays), emitting `message.delivered.v1`. no new delivery
mechanism to invent, just the ships one applied to messages.

**new service**: `apps/comms-service`, its own pg schema (`comms`),
matching how ship-service/market-service each own one thing. `messages`
table: `mid, from, to (null for station chat), stid (station chat
only), body, sent, deliver, delivered` - `from`/`to` bare, no
underscores, the same compound-id move phase 1's own naming reference
already makes for `from_station → from` / `to_station → to` on ships,
just applied to player ids here instead of station ids. commands/events:
`message.send.requested` → `message.sent` (queued) / `message.delivered`
(poll-driven) / `message.send.rejected` (e.g. unknown recipient).

**privacy, per `permissions.md`'s own model**: a direct message reaches
only its 2 participants - the same owner-only ws routing `feed.js`
already does for private ship/wallet events. station chat is public to
players at that station, the same allowlist shape already used for
market/ship broadcasts.

touches: new `apps/comms-service` (handlers, migrations, a poll),
`packages/contracts` (new command/events), `apps/gateway` (routes + feed
routing), `client/js` (a messages panel - already sketched, never built,
in `client.md`'s old layout mockup).

**done ✔, server side only.** comms-service, the contracts, the gateway
routes, the feed routing and the read model all landed. the client panel
did not - the client rewrite is an open decision (see
[phase.4.md](phase.4.md)), so a panel built against today's client would
be thrown away. the panel moves to that rewrite. every message route
already works over http.


### step 3.5 - ΔV mechanics, in-system travel - done ✔

`game.md`'s own reading list points straight at this: a brachistochrone
trajectory - constant thrust to the midpoint, flip, constant thrust to
stop - "how fast could you travel between planets with continuous
acceleration and deceleration? (expanse-like)". replaces the flat
`SUBLIGHT` speed cap in-system rides on today
(`packages/domain/src/universe.js`) with something closer to how ships
actually fly in that setting.

**scope, decided by what already exists**: interstellar routes (`c=1`
links between stars) keep today's constant-velocity relativistic model
as-is - it's Krugman's own paper's own simplification ("ships travel at
constant velocity v < c... no acceleration phases",
[The.Theory.of.Interstellar.Trade.md](../../docs/The.Theory.of.Interstellar.Trade.md)),
and a real relativistic-rocket version of this would be a much bigger,
separate physics problem. ΔV applies to in-system travel only, where the
accelerations involved are small enough for plain Newtonian mechanics
and the numbers stay game-sized (seconds to minutes, not years).

**the model**: symmetric brachistochrone, `t = 2 · √(d / a)`, `a`
derived from the hull and fitted maneuver drive designed in step 3.3.
it still needs an AU/s² - or converted m/s² - unit decision at step
start; today's distances are in AU. it replaces `SUBLIGHT`'s flat cap.
an in-system route may still set an upper bound a ship cannot
out-accelerate. `apps/ship-service/src/travel.js` branches on route type:
`c < 1` → brachistochrone using `acceleration`, `c === 1` → today's
formula, untouched.

**left out of this step, on purpose**: player-controlled burns (choosing
accelerate/coast/decelerate, fuel mass, cargo weight affecting thrust) -
`game.md`'s fuller vision ("let player decide about acceleration/burn
duration/fuel mass"). this step uses a rig-derived acceleration but
no burn controls. a tunable-burn, `fuel`-and-cargo-`weight` economy is a
distinct, later idea (see "explicitly out" - orbital mechanics) since it
changes the game's controls, not only its math. acceleration is
snapshotted for a leg at departure; propulsion cannot be refitted in
transit, so an existing arrival time never changes under the ship.

touches `apps/ship-service/src/travel.js` (the branch), the step 3.3
hull/rig model (acceleration and unit helpers), and client eta previews
(`client/js/map.js`'s `routeInfo()`).

**done ✔.** the open unit call went to **m/s²**, with the conversion
constants next to `AU` in `universe.js`. `c` stays on every route, and
changes job: it is now the peak speed a ship must not pass, not the only
speed it flies. a leg under the cap takes `2·√(d/a)`; a leg that reaches
the cap coasts between the 2 burns and takes `d/c + c/a`. that second
formula approaches `d/c` as `a` grows, so the old flat-speed model is
this same model with an unlimited drive - a useful property, and a test
asserts it.

**the `maneuver` family got its first modules**: `maneuver.mk1`, a
net-zero placeholder on the starter rig, and `maneuver.mk2`, gated on
`reactor.mk2`'s power rank exactly as `cruise.mk2` is. the starter hull
gained a `maneuver1` slot, `acceleration_base` and `acceleration_max`.
`deriveStats` resolves the new stat through the existing `resolve`
helper - no new arithmetic.

**one thing the step plan did not predict**: `#shortestTime`'s dijkstra
edge weight assumed travel time grows in a straight line with distance.
it does not any more. a square root is subadditive, so a direct link now
always beats the same distance split over 2 hops, and every "tied route"
claim in `packages/domain/readme.md` became wrong. the weight now calls
`legTime()` too, and the readme is rewritten.


### step 3.6 - universe growth, more stations

**split universe.js first.** the file runs 491 lines, and it holds 4
jobs. only one of them grows with content:

| lines | what | grows? |
|-------|------|--------|
| 9-245 | `class Universe` - the graph, `path()`, `distance` | no |
| 254-343 | `closest`, `trace`, `au()`, `legTime()`, constants | no |
| **345-420** | **the systems, the stations, the links** | **yes** |
| 422-480 | goods, starter ship, constants, `universeData` | slowly |

```
packages/domain/src/universe/
  graph.js    the engine
  space.js    AU, SUBLIGHT, LY, au(), legTime()
  systems.js  the map data - the only file content touches
  goods.js    the goods table
  index.js    composes them, exports universeData
```

`packages/domain/src/index.js` is the only importer, so the move costs
one line.

**a system declares orbits, and the links fall out of the radii.** the
comment above Sol's links spends 20 lines to derive `au(0.613)` and
`au(8.537)` by hand, and to argue which direct link beats the long way
round. that derivation belongs in code:

```js
system('sol', {
    name: 'Sol', star: 'G2V yellow dwarf',
    gateway: 'sol.outpost',
    orbits: {
        'sol.mercury': { name: 'Mercury Deep', au: 0.387, produces: { ore: 10 }, consumes: { grain: 6 }},
        ...
    },
})
```

`link(a, b) = |au(a) - au(b)|` at `SUBLIGHT`. 3 rules build the set:
every station links to its orbit neighbours, every station links to the
gateway, and a link drops when a 3rd station sits between the ends and
the detour costs no more time. `legTime()` is subadditive, so the direct
link always wins - the comment's prose becomes an assertion.

**an inner well is `orbits` with more than one entry.** a bare gateway
declares one. that is the whole distinction, and it needs no new idea.

**goods gain one validation pass at build**: every `produces`,
`consumes` and `stocks` gid must name a good or a module that exists. a
typo fails silently today.

#### the candidates

distances come from `docs/hygdata_v42.csv`. names come from
[game.md](../../docs/game.md)'s "notable sifi refs".

**built ✔.** distances come from `docs/hygdata_v42.csv`, and every
star link in the map is a real one.

| system | distance | type | inner well |
|--------|----------|------|------------|
| Ran, ε Eridani | 10.49 ly | K2V | yes, 3 stations |
| Procyon | 11.46 ly | F5IV-V | yes, 3 stations |
| Lalande 21185 | 8.31 ly | M2V | yes, 2 stations |
| Ross 154 | 9.69 ly | M3.5Ve | no, gateway only |
| Lacaille 9352 | 10.68 ly | M2/M3V | no, gateway only |

the existing stars gained inner systems, except Alpha Centauri:
Barnards Star, Wolf 359 and Sirius take 2 each, and Alpha stays a bare
exchange. the map now runs 23 stations and 35 links against 10 and 15
before, which is where the O(V²) scan starts to cost - so the heap
lands with something to measure.

station names carry the [game.md](../../docs/game.md) "notable sifi refs": Rama,
Rorschach, Bebop, Solaris, Planetes and the Qeng Ho.

**Alpha Centauri carries 6 star links and one station.** it is the
crossroads, and Sol keeps its 2 links, so the frontier stays behind the
hubs. Ran sits in the far corner, through Sirius or Lacaille 9352.

2 tests hold the content: every system keeps at least its gateway, and
every station reaches every other. an orphan system now fails the
build.

#### classes at the boundary

`Good`, `Sys` and `Station` take a raw object and validate it in the
constructor, the way `Hull` and `Design` already do in `modules.js`.
the types then live on the class, so every consumer reads the same
shape whatever the raw data came from. reuse the predicates in
`packages/contracts/src/field.js` - `nonEmptyString`, `positiveNumber`.

a constructor sees one row, so it cannot catch a cross reference. a
typo in `produces: { gráin: 7 }` builds a valid object. the composer
catches it, in 2 passes:

1. construct every `Good` - the registry
2. construct every `Sys` and `Station`
3. resolve: every `produces`, `consumes` and `stocks` gid must name a
   good or a module that exists
4. derive the links from the orbit radii
5. freeze

pass 3 is pure - no pool, no env, no disk. so it runs in the fast ci
job, and a typo fails the pull request before the integration job
starts.

#### seed data is code

the raw data stays in the repository, and it ships inside the image.

an event only means something against the map that computed it.
`ship.departed { from: 'sol.mars', years_abs: 8.6 }` reads as 8.6
because of one set of orbit radii. change a radius after players fly
there, and a projection rebuild answers differently from the events on
record. **the seed is part of the event log's meaning.**

so the admin board of [phase.4.md](phase.4.md) step 4.4 holds 2 powers,
and they are not alike:

| | changes | how it changes |
|-|---------|----------------|
| the universe - systems, stations, goods, modules | the meaning of past events | a commit, a review, a deploy |
| the tunables - TIME_SCALE, STARTER_CREDITS, spread, drift | only what happens next | live, at runtime |

the classes make the file format a later question. `Station` converts
plain AU in its constructor, so a `.js` literal, a `.json` file and a
row from the admin board all produce the same validated object. build
the classes first, and swap the source when the board needs it.

see [deploy.md](../../docs/deploy.md) for the seed hash that names which map ran.

see [game.md](../../docs/game.md)'s "the gravity well" for the term that makes an
inner orbit expensive. it is not part of this step, and this step gives
it somewhere to apply.


only Sol is built out (`client.md` TODO, `packages/domain/readme.md`
TODO). Alpha Centauri, Barnards Star, Wolf 359 and Sirius hold one
station each. add 2-3 more per system, same pattern as Sol's build-out
(`docs/progress.md`'s "universe growth - the stations" writeup): real
orbital-radius data, produces/consumes pairs, `SUBLIGHT` in-system links
to that system's own gateway station (or the new ΔV model from 3.5, if
that's landed by then).

also closes the perf debt this growth motivates: `path()` is a linear
scan for the closest unvisited station, O(V²) per call - fine at a few
dozen stations, wrong at 10x this size (noted in `docs/progress.md` and
`packages/domain/readme.md`). swap it for a binary heap.

touches `packages/domain/src/universe.js` only - `client/js/map.js`
already lays stations out from count, not hardcoded positions (true
since Sol's own build-out).

### step 3.7 - travel manifest visualization

closes the client-facing half of phase 2.4. ship-service resolves and
drives a manifest already; nothing shows it. `client.md`'s own old
header mockup already sketches the target:
`hops: mars → 2d → sol → 3y → alpha`.

the manifest doesn't reach the client today - `ship.departed.v1`/
`ship.arrived.v1` payloads don't carry it, a deliberate call made
building 2.4 to keep the event shape unchanged. **open call at step
start**: expose `manifest` on `GET /api/ship` only (cheap, hydrate-time,
matches how the rest of `state.ship` already works) vs also putting it
on the ws events (live-updates as hops advance, more wire surface).
recommend REST-only - a manifest shortens once every few seconds at
most, a re-hydrate on every `ship.arrived.v1` is enough.

touches `apps/gateway/src/queries.js` (`ships()`), `client/js/state.js`/
`events.js` (carry `manifest` through), and a small ship-detail panel in
`client/js/render.js`/`index.html`, styled after the existing mockup.


### step 3.8 - jsdoc pass, close the types gap

last step of the phase, on purpose - it touches every package and app,
so it runs after everything else lands, not before.

today's split: each package's real types live in a hand-written
`types/*.d.ts`, separate from its untyped `.js` implementation. a
consumer importing the package sees full types (`package.json`'s
`exports` field points there); editing the `.js` source directly shows
none, since the two files are never linked. new files stop this from
growing - see `.claude/CLAUDE.md`'s "Types" section, JSDoc from here on.
this step is the backfill for everything written before that rule.

**scope, proven by a real dry run**: turning on `checkJs` against
`apps/` + `packages/` (excluding `test/`, `scripts/`, and the broken
`?title=` test-import convention - a separate, unrelated fix) surfaced
72 errors across 15 files. 2 were real bugs, caught only by the type
checker: `shipNames.js`'s `shuffle()` compared a function reference to
a number instead of calling it, so the name pools never actually
shuffled; `previewRig`'s `operation` argument had an optional/
required shape mismatch. most of the rest were one-line annotation
gaps. the number stays small enough to do as one step, not a phase of
its own.

the actual work: fold each package's `types/*.d.ts` into JSDoc inside
the `.js` files they describe, then delete the now-redundant `.d.ts`.
turn `checkJs` on in the root `tsconfig.json` once the fold is done.
`packages/service/src/index.js`'s base class (14 of the 72 dry-run
errors alone) is the one spot that looked like a real typing-design
gap, not just a missing annotation - its subclasses don't cleanly fit
the inferred shape, worth deciding deliberately rather than papering
over with `any`.

a full TypeScript migration and a Go rewrite were both considered and
set aside for now - see `tech.debt.md`'s "language/types migration"
entry for the reasoning.


explicitly out (phase 4+, someday, or standalone)
------------------------------------------------

from `permissions.md`: the **transponder switch** and **public trade
feed** - both fully designed there already, deliberately not picked up
this phase. **player-to-player trading** stays a distinct idea from the
messenger step - not scheduled even in `permissions.md`, and messaging
between players is not trading with them. admin mutating ops (credit a
wallet, restock a station - `permissions.md`'s own words: "wait for a
later phase"), a net-worth leaderboard.

from `game.md`: the full hull catalogue and buying ships (freighter,
military, exploration, privateer, repair, passenger, prison barge),
orbital mechanics +
interactive system maps + player-controlled burns (KSP-style piloting -
the fuller version of step 3.5's physics, with fuel mass and player
control, not just the trajectory model), multi-good station
consume/produce + non-good services (repair/security/tech/workforce),
station types beyond visibility (research lab, military base, prison
barge, agriculture), exploration/colonization/factions, port-operation
animations, a 3D client.

from `tech.debt.md`: dockerized deploy (needs a real plan first, not
scoped enough to schedule), a lit.dev-style frontend rewrite (the doc's
own call: could be a standalone repo, not necessarily part of theseus),
`using`/`Symbol.dispose` for db client acquisition (fits
`packages/db/src/query.js`'s `withClient` only, a small win - not worth
this phase's time over the items above).

from `client.md`: the stickable/draggable/resizable panel layout
rework, `rs.file` cache headers (dev-only, stays noted not promoted -
same call phase 2 made).
